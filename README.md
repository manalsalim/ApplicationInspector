# Introduction 

Microsoft Application Inspector is a software source code characterization tool that helps **identify coding features of first or third party software components** based on well-known library/API calls and is helpful in security and non-security use cases. It uses hundreds or rules and regex patterns to surface interesting characteristics of source code to aid in determining **what the software is** or **what it does** and received industry attention as a new and valuable contribution to OSS on [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-application-inspector-is-now-open-source-so-use-it-to-test-code-security/
), [SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-introduces-free-source-code-analyzer), [CSOOnline](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3514732/microsoft-s-offers-application-inspector-to-probe-untrusted-open-source-code.html), [Linux.com/news](https://www.linux.com/news/microsoft-application-inspector-is-now-open-source-so-use-it-to-test-code-security/), [HelpNetSecurity](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/01/17/microsoft-application-inspector/
), Twitter and more and was first featured on [Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/01/16/introducing-microsoft-application-inspector/).

Application Inspector is different from traditional static analysis tools in that it doesn't attempt to identify "good" or "bad" patterns; it simply reports what it finds against a set of over 400 rule patterns for feature detection including features that impact security such as the use of cryptography and more.  This can be extremely helpful in reducing the time needed to determine what Open Source or other components do by examining the source directly rather than trusting to limited documentation or recommendations.  

The tool supports scanning various programming languages including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Objective-C, Go, Ruby, PowerShell and [more](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInspector/wiki/2.1-Field:-applies_to-(languages-support)) and can scan projects with mixed language files.  It also includes HTML, JSON and text output formats with the default being an HTML report similar to the one shown here.

It includes a filterable confidence indicator to help minimize false positives matches as well as customizable default rules and conditional match logic.

# Goals

Microsoft Application Inspector helps you in securing your applications from start to deployment.

**Design Choices** - Enables you to choose which components meet your needs with a smaller footprint of unnecessary or unknowns features for keeping your application attack surface smaller as well as help to verify expected ones i.e. industry standard crypto only. 

**Identifying Feature Deltas** - Detects changes between component versions which can be critical for detecting injection of backdoors.

**Automating Security Compliance Checks** - Use to identify components with features that require additional security scrutiny, approval or SDL compliance as part of your build pipeline or create a repository of metadata regarding all of your enterprise application.

# Contribute

We have a strong default starting base of Rules for feature detection.  But there are many feature identification patterns yet to be defined and we invite you to **submit ideas** on what you want to see or take a crack at defining a few.  This is a chance to literally impact the open source ecosystem helping provide a tool that everyone can use.  See the [Rules](https://github.com/microsoft/applicationinspector/wiki) section of the wiki for more.

# Customizing Rules

For customizing the rules used, see the project [wiki] (https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInspector/wiki) for additional background on Rules, Tags and more used to identify features which use a systematic hierarchical nomenclature e.g. Cryptography.Protocol.TLS to more easily represent features.

```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagdiff --src1 /home/user/project1 --src2 /home/user/project2
```
##### Basic use
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagdiff --src1 /home/user/project1 --src2 /home/user/project2 -t equality
```
##### Basic use
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagdiff --src1 /home/user/project1 --src2 /home/user/project2 -t inequality
```
### Tag Test Command

Used to verify (pass/fail) that a specified set of rule tags is present or not present in a project e.g.
user only wants to know true/false if cryptography is present as expected or if personal data is not present
as expected and get a simple yes/no result rather than a full analysis report.

Note: The user is expected to use the *custom-rules-path* option rather than the default ruleset because it is 
unlikely that any source package would contain all of the default rules and testing for all default rules present in source
will likely yield a false or fail result in most cases.
```
  Usage: dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagtest [arguments] [options

  Arguments:
  -s, --source-path          Source file or directory to inspect

  -t, --test-type            Test to perform [rulespresent|rulesnotpresent]

  -r, --custom-rules-path    Custom rules file or directory path

  -o, --output-file-path     Output file path

  -k, --file-path-exclusions     Exclude source files (none|default: sample,example,test,docs,.vs,.git)

  -x, --console-verbosity    Console verbosity [high|medium|low|none]

  -l, --log-file-path        Log file path

  -v, --log-file-level       Log file level [Debug|Info|Warn|Error|Trace|Fatal|Off]

  --help                     Display this help screen.

 ```
#### Simplest use to see if a set of rules are all present in a project
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagtest -s /home/user/project1 -r /home/user/myrules.json
```
#### Basic use
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagtest -s /home/user/project1 -r /home/user/myrules.json -t rulespresent
```
#### Basic use
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagtest -s /home/user/project1 -r /home/user/myrules.json -t rulesnotpresent
```
### Export Tags Command

  Simple export of the ruleset tags representing what features are supported for detection
```
  Usage: dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll exporttags [arguments] [options]

  Arguments:
  -r, --custom-rules-path       Custom rules path

  -i, --ignore-default-rules    Ignore default rules bundled with application. 

  -o, --output-file-path        Path to output file

  -x, --console-verbosity       Console verbosity [high|medium|low]

  --help                        Display this help screen.

```
##### Export default rule tags to console
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll exporttags
```
##### Using output file
```

```
##### With custom rules and output file
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll exporttags -r /home/user/myproject/customrules -o /hom/user/myproject/exportags.txt
```
### Verify Rules Command

Verify a custom ruleset is compatible and error free for use with Application Inspector.  Note the default ruleset is already
verified as part of the Build process and does not normally require a separate verification.
```
  Usage: dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll verifyrules [arguments]

  Arguments:

  -d, --verify-default-rules Verify default rules

  -r, --custom-rules-path    Custom rules file or directory path

  -o, --output-file-path     Output file path

  -x, --console-verbosity    Console verbosity [high|medium|low|none]

  -l, --log-file-path        Log file path

  -v, --log-file-level       Log file level [Debug|Info|Warn|Error|Trace|Fatal|Off]

  --help                     Display this help screen.

```
##### Simpliest case

    --help                      Display this help screen.

```
##### Simplist case to repack default rules into default or alternate location
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll packrules -d -o /home/user/myproject/defaultrules.json
```
##### Using custom rules only
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll packrules -r /home/user/myproject/customrules -o /home/user/mypackedcustomrules.json
```
