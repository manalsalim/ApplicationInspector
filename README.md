# Introduction 

Microsoft Application Inspector is a software source code analysis tool that helps identify and surface well-known features and other interesting characteristics of source code to aid in determining **what the software is** or **what it does**.  It has received attention on [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-application-inspector-is-now-open-source-so-use-it-to-test-code-security/
), [SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-introduces-free-source-code-analyzer), [CSOOnline](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3514732/microsoft-s-offers-application-inspector-to-probe-untrusted-open-source-code.html), [Linux.com/news](https://www.linux.com/news/microsoft-application-inspector-is-now-open-source-so-use-it-to-test-code-security/), [HelpNetSecurity](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2020/01/17/microsoft-application-inspector/
), Twitter and more and was first featured on [Microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/01/16/introducing-microsoft-application-inspector/).

Application Inspector is different from traditional static analysis tools in that it doesn't attempt to identify "good" or "bad" patterns; it simply reports what it finds against a set of over 400 rule patterns for feature detection including features that impact security such as the use of cryptography and more.  This can be extremely helpful in reducing the time needed to determine what Open Source or other components do by examining the source directly rather than trusting to limited documentation or recommendations.  

The tool supports scanning various programming languages including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Objective-C, Go, Ruby, PowerShell and [more](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInspector/wiki/2.1-Field:-applies_to-(languages-support)) and can scan projects with mixed language files.  It also includes HTML, JSON and text output formats with the default being an HTML report similar to the one shown here.

It includes a filterable confidence indicator to help minimize false positives matches as well as customizable default rules and conditional match logic.

# Goals

Application Inspector helps **inform you better** for choosing the best components to meet your needs with a smaller footprint of unknowns for keeping your application attack surface smaller.  It helps you to avoid inclusion of components with unexpected features you don't want.  

Application Inspector can help **identify feature deltas** or changes between component versions which can be critical for detecting injection of backdoors.

It can be used to **automate detection of features** of interest to identify components that require additional scrutiny as part of your build pipeline or create a repository of metadata regarding all of your enterprise application.

Basically, we created Application Inspector to help us **identify risky third party software components** based on their specific features, but the tool is helpful in many non-security contexts as well. 

Application Inspector v1.0 is now in GENERAL AUDIENCE release status. Your feedback is important to us. If you're interested in contributing, please review the CONTRIBUTING.md.

# Contribute

We have a strong default starting base of Rules for feature detection.  But there are many feature identification patterns yet to be defined and we invite you to **submit ideas** on what you want to see or take a crack at defining a few.  This is a chance to literally impact the open source ecosystem helping provide a tool that everyone can use.  See the [Rules](https://github.com/microsoft/applicationinspector/wiki) section of the wiki for more.  

# Getting Application Inspector

To use Application Inspector, download the relevant binary (either platform-specific or the multi-platform .NET Core release) from the Releases page or see the NuGet Support page in our wiki. If you use the .NET Core version, you will need to have .NET Core 3.1 or later installed.  See the [JustRunIt.md](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInspector/blob/master/JustRunIt.md) or [Build.md](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInspector/blob/master/BUILD.md) files for help.

# Developers 

It might be valuable to consult the project wiki for additional background on Rules, Tags and more used to identify features.  Tags are used as a systematic hierarchical nomenclature e.g. Cryptography.Protocol.TLS to more easily represent features.  The commands may be used programmatically using just the Microsoft.CST.ApplicationInspector.Commands package.

## Usage

Application Inspector is availble as a command line tool or NuGet package and is supported on Windows, Linux, or MacOS.

```
##### Basic use
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagdiff --src1 /home/user/project1 --src2 /home/user/project2 -t equality
```
##### Basic use
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagdiff --src1 /home/user/project1 --src2 /home/user/project2 -t inequality
```
### Tag Test Command

Used to verify (pass/fail) that a specified set of rule tags is present or not present in a project e.g.
user only wants to know true/false if cryptography is present as expected or if personal data is not present
as expected and get a simple yes/no result rather than a full analysis report.

Note: The user is expected to use the *custom-rules-path* option rather than the default ruleset because it is 
unlikely that any source package would contain all of the default rules and testing for all default rules present in source
will likely yield a false or fail result in most cases.
```
  Usage: dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagtest [arguments] [options

  Arguments:
  -s, --source-path          Source file or directory to inspect

  -t, --test-type            Test to perform [rulespresent|rulesnotpresent]

  -r, --custom-rules-path    Custom rules file or directory path

 ```
#### Simplest use to see if a set of rules are all present in a project
```
  dotnet ApplicationInspector.CLI.dll tagtest -s /home/user/project1 -r /home/user/myrules.json
```
#### Basic use
